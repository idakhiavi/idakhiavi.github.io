![Charcuterie Table](/_posts/2.jpg)

Egon Schiele’s jagged lines and raw hues. Munch’s haunted skies and aching faces. They sit on my table, not in frames, but as coasters—watching me slice, arrange, and layer.

A charcuterie board is my canvas. Cured reds from chorizo, pale golds of aged cheddar, bruised purples from figs, the deep green of olives—each one a pigment. I find myself matching, clashing, softening, sharpening. It’s not just food; it’s an argument in color, texture, and form.

Like Schiele’s portraits, I want tension on the plate. Like Munch’s skies, I want mood in the spread. It’s fleeting art, gone in the time it takes for hands to reach across the table, but in that moment, it lives, fully.
