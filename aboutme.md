# "I am nobody, who are you?"
Hi, I’m Ida, engineer by degree, explorer by nature, and a firm believer that curiosity is the best debugging tool. With a B.Eng. and an M.Sc. in Computer Science, I’ve wandered through the worlds of code, data, and design, picking up stories (and a few coffee addictions) along the way.

When I’m not building systems or untangling tricky problems, you’ll find me reading something about art or philosophy, wandering new cities, or arguing with myself over the best escapre from existential dread. I love making complex ideas simple, and I believe every task should feel a little bit like art: crafted, not just completed.

This blog is my corner of the internet to share thoughts, experiments, and the occasional poetic tangent. Welcome in: 
                                            the light’s always on!
