## üë©‚Äçüíª About Me
Engineer by training, explorer by instinct. I‚Äôve navigated worlds as different as real-time air traffic control systems, AI-powered shipyard analytics, and multi-omics genomic research.  
I‚Äôm happiest at the intersection of **hard technical challenges** and **big-picture problem-solving** ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs squeezing performance out of a protocol stack, turning raw environmental data into insights, or translating genomic complexity into clear visual models.  
My career and research share the same philosophy: **make it work, make it elegant, make it useful**.

## üíº Experience

### **Software Engineer** ‚Äî Frequentis QC, Canada (Jan 2024 ‚Äì Present)
- Develop and maintain high-assurance embedded software for **VoIP gateways** in **air traffic control**, using C++, Java, and shell scripting in mission-critical, real-time environments.
- Design secure, low-latency **SIP protocols** for Air-Ground and Ground-Ground communications.
- Build Qt-based graphical interfaces optimized for resource-constrained embedded systems.
- Conduct full-system lab validation: integrate hardware, simulate real-time calls, capture and analyze network traffic with Wireshark, and verify system performance under operational loads.

### **Software Developer / Data Engineer** ‚Äî Genoa Design International NL, Canada (Feb 2021 ‚Äì Sep 2023)
- Developed interactive dashboards and visualizations with SQL, Power BI, Python, and C#, integrating machine learning (PyTorch, Scikit-learn) for KPI forecasting, anomaly detection, and data imputation.
- Designed REST API-driven microservices and optimized SQL access for improved reporting.
- Built robust ETL pipelines (SSIS, shell scripts, Python, C#) for integrating, cleaning, and transforming ship design and construction data.
- Implemented multi-dimensional OLAP cubes (SSAS) to deliver sub-second querying for complex operational and financial reporting.

### **Web Developer** ‚Äî Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing Systems (Nov 2019 ‚Äì Jul 2020)
- Created Python/FastAPI applications to merge **real-time weather and ocean data** from multiple APIs.
- Applied deep learning to forecast oceanic trends and detect climate-related anomalies.
- Designed Streamlit dashboards to allow researchers and policymakers to interact with climate datasets in real time.

### **Research & Teaching Assistant** ‚Äî Memorial University (Jan 2018 ‚Äì Dec 2020)
- Developed an R-based interactive visualization library for my Master‚Äôs thesis, enabling multi-layered exploration of protein structures by integrating structural and sequence data.
- Applied machine learning to genomic datasets to identify sequence motifs, predict gene regulation patterns, and classify tumor types.
- Mentored students in Computer Logic, Algebra, and Graph Theory, turning abstract concepts into practical tools.

## üéì Education & Publications

### **Master of Science in Computer Science** ‚Äî Memorial University of Newfoundland (GPA: A)  
My Master‚Äôs research sat at the crossroads of **bioinformatics**, **mathematical modeling**, and **visual analytics**.  
I designed computational tools to analyze **multi-omics datasets**, focusing on **transcription factor dimer binding sites** ‚Äî regions of DNA where pairs of proteins regulate gene expression. Traditional models often ignored heterogeneity in binding affinities; my work introduced a novel ‚Äúforked‚Äù position weight matrix approach to capture these complexities.  

This led to:
- **First co-author** publication: *Representing Transcription Factor Dimer Binding Sites Using Forked-Position Weight Matrices and Forked-Sequence Logos* (under review, *Nucleic Acids Research*).
- Conference presentation at *Applied Bioinformatics in Life Sciences*, showcasing interactive visualizations that made genomic regulatory patterns accessible to non-specialists.

### **Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Hardware Engineering**  
Specialized in **microprocessors**, **FPGA design**, **signal processing**, and **VLSI architecture**.  
This foundation in hardware-level thinking informs my work in embedded systems today ‚Äî from optimizing memory footprints to understanding real-time constraints at the silicon level.

## üå± Interests
Philosophy, cinema, hiking, travel, culinary adventures, classic literature ‚Äî and drawing unexpected parallels between poetry and system architecture.
